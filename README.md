# Global-Wheat-Detection---Kaggle-Competition
GWD - Global Wheat Detection In this competition, we asked to detect wheat heads from images of wheat plants from all around the world. These images are used to estimate the density and size of wheat heads in different varieties, so Farmers can use the data to assess health and maturity when making management decisions in their fields. However, accurate wheat head detection in outdoor field images can be visually challenging, There is often overlap of dense wheat plants, and the wind can blur the photographs. Additionally, appearances vary due to maturity, color, genotype, and head orientation. To better gauge the performance for unseen genotypes, environments, and observational conditions, the training dataset covers multiple regions, and we will use more than 3000 images from Europe and Noeth America.
